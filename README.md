**Semantic Search Engine**

This is a practice and also a demonstration of how semantic search engine works.

## Tech Stacks

- Next.js
- ShadCn
- LangChain (Google Generative Text Embeddings model)
- Upstash vector database
- PostgreSQL

I have followed a good tutorial from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cqFkK3WLvg)

The only difference is that I used LangChain and the instructor used OpenAI Embeddings model.
